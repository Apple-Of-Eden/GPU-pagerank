### Pagerank implementation with a flattened linked list structure on the GPU (using CUDA)

Not really for public eyes.

Can handle graphs up to slightly over ~66 million nodes. Use /graphGenerator to do so

[Note: this was run on a Quadro K4000, and the code expects to be able to run at least 1024 concurrent threads.]
